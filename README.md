# Metagenome Pipeline

Using pipelines developed by [Geof Hannigan](https://github.com/Microbiology) that can be found 
[here](https://github.com/SchlossLab/Hannigan_CRCVirome_PNAS_2017) run through a toy data set based on data from 
the [Zeller, et al. study](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.15252/msb.20145645/abstract). 

* First goal is to run data through established pipeline
* Second goal is to rewrite perl scripts with Julia

This may set up usage for downstream analysis of metageomes for future projects. Having this open will also help facilitate suggestions 
and improvements from others within this area.


**Languages Used**

* Julia v0.5.2
* Bash

**Needed Programs**

* sra tool kit v2.8.2-1
* aspera download client
* fastx v0.0.13 (open to alternatives that do a similar job)
